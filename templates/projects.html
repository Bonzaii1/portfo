                            </header>
                            <p>One of my significant projects involved the design and implementation of a student
                                management system
                                tailored for universities in Fiji and Papua New Guinea. This venture allowed me to
                                utilize my skills
                                in Java, SpringBoot, and Oracle Databases, which not only enhanced my proficiency in
                                developing robust
                                systems but also honed my expertise in object-oriented programming, data structures, and
                                algorithms.
                                This Project was a lot of fun and had many different challenges, one of them being
                                modifying the Databases
                                to reflect the information that they use in their respective universities. Removing a
                                lot of the current fields
                                that they use had some heavy consequences on the system, as it was reliant on many of
                                them. So it was our job to
                                go in and patch in the holes that the information would have left behind.</p>

                            </header>
                            <p>Using computer vision tricks, our system would keep an eagle eye on cars coming in.
                                It's like having Sherlock Holmes in the form of software, figuring out where the license
                                plates are,
                                and even reading the secret code written on them. How? We call it OCR, or Optical
                                Character Recognition,
                                which is a fancy way of saying our system can read those letters and numbers on the
                                plates.

                                But here's the real magic: our system won't just say "Hi" to anyone. It's got a list â€“ a
                                list of cars that
                                are allowed to party inside our campus. When a car rolls in, UMScan checks its name
                                against t
                                he list. If it's an invited guest (meaning it's on the list), the gates open and the
                                party begins. If not,
                                well, the system won't budge. Unauthorized entries? Not on its watch! Plus, it keeps a
                                journal of all the
                                cars that come and go. Security? Check! Efficiency? Double-check!</p>

                                <h3>Perimetral Security with Raspberry Pi</h3>
                            </header>
                            <p>Imagine a datacenter shielded by an invisible fortress. That's exactly what we've built
                                with our
                                "Enhanced Perimeter Security" project. We turned a regular datacenter into a fortress of
                                digital sensors,
                                all thanks to our trusty Raspberry Pi.

                                Our secret weapon? The concept of threading. Each sensor, from motion detectors to
                                temperature gauges,
                                runs in its own thread. They're like sentinels on the lookout, working together
                                seamlessly yet independently
                                to capture real-time metrics. This multi-threaded approach ensures that no anomaly slips
                                through the cracks,
                                allowing us to monitor the perimeter with unparalleled precision.

                                But that's just the beginning. We've also established a Mosquitto broker system, which
                                serves as the nerve center.
                                It coordinates all these vigilant sensors and relays critical data to an API that we've
                                custom-built.
                                If any sensor detects an outlier, you can bet our system will catch it, flag it, and
                                swiftly notify the right people
                                through our alert API. Not only that but the same broker also sends a message through
                                the OneSignal
                                service, allowing these same alerts to run straight to your phone.

                    <p>These are some of my favorite Projects and I had a lot of fun making them. They were innovative
                        and challenging each in their
                        own rights. I dont want to stop here though, I want to keep working on different projects and be
                        part of something big, I want
                        to meet new, bright, and enthusiastic people who will help me learn and grow. I believe I can
                        find that with you, so give me
                        an opportunity into your team!
